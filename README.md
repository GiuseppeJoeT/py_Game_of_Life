# Conway’s Game of Life

### Introduction

Conway’s Game of Life is a simulation of cells, which live or die depending
on the cells around them. 
At each generation in the game, each cell is evaluated
on the following criteria:
- A cell can die from:
- under-population (less than two neighbours)
- over-population (more than three neighbours)
- A cell can come back to life if surrounded by three neighbours
- A cell carries on living if it has two or three live neighbours

These simple rules can produce complicated and unexpected ecosystems.
